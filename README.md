## üöÄ How to Get Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or later
- Maven 3.2+
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL Server

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishisihare90/TrackIt.git
cd TrackIt
```

### 2. Setup Backend

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    ```
2.  **Create your configuration file**:
    - Inside the `src/main/resources/` directory, create a new file named `application.properties`.
3.  **Copy the template**:
    - Open `application-example.properties`, copy all of its content, and paste it into your new `application.properties` file.
4.  **Configure your secrets**:
    - In the **new `application.properties` file**, update the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` to match your local MySQL setup.
    - Set a long, random string for your `secreteJwtString` property.
5.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend server will start on **http://localhost:5050**.

### 3. Setup Frontend

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../Frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
      npm run dev
    ```
    The React application will be available at **http://localhost:5173**.
